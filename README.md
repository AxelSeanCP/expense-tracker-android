## üìã To Do

- **Search Functionality:** Add a search bar to the "View Expenses" screen to allow users to search for specific expenses.
- **Date Picker Improvements:** Persist the selected date in the input screen after an expense has been added, instead of resetting to the current date.
- **Code Documentation:** Add more comments and documentation to key functions and classes for clarity.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note for Debugging

Due to the use of a local database and Room's schema validation, it is highly recommended to **uninstall the app** from your device or emulator when making changes to the database schema (e.g., adding a new column to the `Expense` entity). This will ensure the old database file is deleted and a new one is created correctly on the next run.
