# Expense Tracker

Android app to track expenses, built using jetpack compose and room library for storing data. Part of University KKN requirements.

## TODO

- modularize the main activity into 4 parts (view expenses and delete or editing, input expenses, export or import data, data summarization)
- summarize expenses based on the month, export and import should implement the same feature
- add confirmation dialog when deleting all expenses or deleting expenses

> note: when debugging uninstall the app as well to ensure the database is deleted.
